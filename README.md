# Deep_Learning_Assignments

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Deep_Learning_Assignments" repository! This repository contains all the assignments completed as part of the Deep Learning class I have participated in. Each assignment in this repository is designed to tackle various concepts and applications of deep learning, ranging from the fundamentals of neural networks to more advanced topics such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and reinforcement learning.

## Repository Navigation

- **Assignment 1:** Working with tensorflow and pytorch
- **Assignment 2:** Working with the Qminst datset and hypothesis on different optimizers, activation fucntions and more

Each directory contains the assignment or project files, including Jupyter notebooks, datasets (if not too large or linked to an external source), and a README file detailing the objectives, methodology, and findings.

## Installation and Running Projects

To run the projects contained in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your machine, along with several key libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep_Learning_Assignments.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd Deep_Learning_Assignments

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
